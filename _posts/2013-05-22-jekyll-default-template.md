More comments about my first Jekyll setup so far.

I have found out that the default template is not ideal for me for the following
reasons :

* HTML semantic could be improved :
  * `h1` is the blog title on all pages
  * it could use `time` tag for post dates
  * it could use `article` tags
  * etc;
* Posts markdown generated HTML uses single quotes for attributes;
* Provided stylesheet has no titles (h1, h2, h3) styles.

I'll try pull requesting some of theses improvements when I get further into
this experiment.
